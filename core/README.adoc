= xtdb-core

This project contains all major codec, transaction, indexing, query and API
functionality.

All protocols for interacting with pluggable storage (Kafka, LMDB, RocksDB
etc.) are defined within `xtdb-core` but the implementations of these protocols
exist in other projects within this repository. Therefore, use of `xtdb-core`
by itself (using `xtdb.mem-kv`) does not provide any persistence.
