XTDB's link:https://docs.xtdb.com/openapi/index.html[HTTP API] supports multiple formats including link:https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format[Transit,window=_blank].

We expect most developers to prefer using link:json[JSON].

To have XTDB return Transit, set the `Accept` header to `application/transit+json`. +
Similarly to send Transit to XTDB, set the `Content-Type` header to `application/transit+json`.
