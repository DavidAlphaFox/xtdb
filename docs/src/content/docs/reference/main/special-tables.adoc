// TODO: Can users write/delete these tables? If so, what happens?

XTDB only has one special table (link:https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/2500[at the moment]).

== `:xt/txs`

// TODO: Is this correct?
Contains all submitted transactions on the node.

=== Columns

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Column | Description

| `:xt/id`
| The transaction ID.

| `:xt/committed?`
| Boolean indicating whether the transaction has been committed.

| `:xt/error`
| If the transaction errored, this will contain the error message.
|===

=== Example Usage

To figure out why a transaction failed:

[source,clojure]
----
;; We've run this transaction
include::{test}[tags=try-update,indent=0]

;; Let's see why it's failed
include::{test}[tags=query-txs,indent=0]

;; As you can see, the assert failed.
;; So the user `:john` must not exist!
include::{test}[tags=query-result,indent=0]
