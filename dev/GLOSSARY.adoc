| buffer pool            | A pool of (Arrow) buffers that gets managed for reuse and reference counted. Fetches things from the object store.
| chunk                  | A certain number of rows/documents the DB holds in memory before it flushes them to disk. As of the writing of this document the number is 102400. The content is split into chunks.
| chunk boundary         | The number of rows hold in memory before a flush gets triggered (102400 as of the writing of this document)
| document (or 'row')    | A particular state of an entity. A document describes the state of an entity at a particular point in time.
| entity (or 'record')   | Referring to a unique item in the database that may have different versions (in form of different documents) across time.
| expression             | Think of this like a predicate, test or an if statement in the query languages (SQL/XTQL) that acts on one or multiple columns/variables.
| expression engine (EE) | The expression engine compiles an expression into a function that the query engine then can efficiently execute. It is used for the queries itself as well as for metadata checking.
| IID                    | An internal id for refering to an `xt/id`.
| indexer                | Indexes new data or updates to existing data into the underlying storage.
| ingester               | Retrieves newly arrived transactions from the log and submits them to the indexer.
| live index             | The part of the db (data) that has not been written to disk and will be flushed
| log                    | Holds all transactions monotonically across system time. In XTDB V2 this is not strictly needed forever as transactions also get indexed into a log (see log indexer) per chunk.
| log indexer            | It's a golden store of temporal information in a format that's relatively easy to replay from. When a transaction gets indexed we also keep a log of the temporal information + some ids to associate with content. Some parts of the kd-tree (or another temporal solution) might only live in memory until we commit the full chunk. This logs assures us that we can recover this ifnormation.
| logical plan           | A relational algebra representation of a query or update. The logical plan is represented as a nested clojure sturcture. This is an XTDB internal representation of a query/update that the engine might do optimizations on (for example an sematically equivalent but more efficient rewrite).
| metadata               | We associate metadata on a per chunk and page level with data. This allows to quickly rule out chunks/pages that don't satisfy certain conditions. Be that temporal or content related.
| metadata manager       | Manages metadata information (reading/writing).
| object-store           | Think of this as something like S3. This is where long lived data resides (doesn't mean it does not get rewritten). Pages are fetched from here. There is also a in-memory version, but that is more for testing purposes. It also contains a caching layer.
| operator               | A relational algebra operator (or some extension thereof). The simplest example is a join.
| page                   | A group of (ideally ~1024) rows. Where possible, we process rows in page batches to amortize the overhead of parsing data, setting up copiers, etc.
| transaction            | Referring to an atomic sequence of operations (put, delete etc...) to be performed on the db. Or alternatively a SQL transaction string.
| watermark              | Holds the resources of the system at a particular point in time.
