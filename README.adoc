= Crux Corda

WIP!

We have four Cordapps here - two production (`corda-contract` and `corda-workflow`) and two test (`iou-contract` and `iou-workflow`).

Things of interest:

* `corda-workflow/src/main/kotlin/crux/corda/workflow/CruxService.kt` - entry point for the Crux driver, a `CordaService`
* `corda-workflow/src/main/clojure/crux/corda/service.clj` - the implementation of the Crux driver
* `corda-contract/src/main/kotlin/crux/corda/contract/CruxState.kt` - interface that Corda states should implement to be included in Crux

* `iou-contract/src/main/kotlin/com/example/contract/IOUState.kt` - example of a Corda state with a Crux mapping
* `iou-workflow/src/test/kotlin/com/example/workflow/IOUFlowTests.kt` - E2E test for the IOU app
